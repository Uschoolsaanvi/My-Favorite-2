    <p id="para" onmouseover="changecolor()"> My favorite hobby is drawing. One of the major reasons why I love drawing because it gives me wings to fly. I can draw anything which is in my mind. I can express my thoughts through drawing. I draw various things. I draw about the current situation. I love drawing because I can speak through my drawing and painting without uttering a word. I love drawing because this hobby is my favorite timepass. I draw in every mood. It helps me put my emotions on the canvas. Whenever I feel low or sad, I just put my sketchbook out from the cupboard and start drawing anything, whatever in my mind. People call it freestyle painting, it means without any purpose. When I draw, I feel happy, because all my friends and family encourage me throughout my journey. After painting on a canvas or drawing in my sketchbook, I feel very satisfyed.</p>
